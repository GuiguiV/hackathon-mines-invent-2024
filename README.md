# Mines 2024 Data Challenge
This repo is to be used in combination with a kaggle notebook (copied in `./main-unet.ipynb` with the pretrained weights not be available).

Our approach is a UNet trained with some data augmentation and with some preprocessing using colorimetric data. More details are given in `Data Challenge Final Presentation.pdf`
